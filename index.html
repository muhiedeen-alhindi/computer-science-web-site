            <h4>Computer Science is not just about 
                computers. Rather it i
                s the study of computation 
                and information, and is
                 a subject which involves you in the very make-up of the world, 
                and over the last 30 yea
                rs it has transformed the way 
                we run our everyday lives
                .Com
                puter Science has had an equally large impact on other areas of science, 
                most of which now require the proce
                ssing and analysis 
                of vast datasets.Computer Science requires logical thinking, creativity and problem solving. Since computer systems are now so large and complex, they are inevitably developed by large teams, so working well with others is also crucial. A Computer Science degree gives you the chance to study exciting new
                 technologies as well as learning skills which will make you highly employable.</h4>
